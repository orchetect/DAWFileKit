    ///
    /// Pro Tools includes Markers in a bin of items called Memory Locations.
    /// Memory Locations include **Markers** and **Selections** (a selection which has in and out
    /// points). Both of these may be defined in two different timebases:
    ///
    /// - **Absolute** (an exact timecode in the project unaffected by tempo track etc.)
    /// - **Bar | Beat** (tied to a musical position which may change if the tempo track changes and
    ///   is not guaranteed to always be the same timecode).
    ///
    /// Pro Tools will only export Markers in its text file export. Selections are not included at
    /// all.
    ///
    /// When Pro Tools exports Markers to the text file, primary location is always included (in the
    /// time format selected while exporting the text file, which defaults to Timecode format) but
    /// there is also a secondary "Time Reference" for each Marker included that depends on the
    /// Marker type.
    ///

    ///
