/// SRT Text (SubRip Subtitles) file.
///
/// A SRT file contains a sequential list of subtitles, each with a timestamp indicating when it should appear and
/// disappear on the screen.
///
/// SRT files are widely supported by media players and video software, making them a popular choice for adding captions
/// to videos.
///
/// The file is, at its basic form, a human-readable text file with a repeating text structure format for each subtitle,
/// and each subtitle block is separated by a blank line.
/// The subtitle block begins with a sequence number on the first line, a timestamp range (in and out) on the second
/// line, and the text content string on the third line.
///
/// The timestamp format is `HH:MM:SS:mls` where `mls` is milliseconds (1/1000th fractions of a second).
///
/// The time units are fixed to two zero-padded digits and fractions fixed to three zero-padded digits.
///
/// Example:
///
/// ```
/// 1
/// 00:00:05,217 --> 00:00:10,854
/// This is the first subtitle.
///
/// 2
/// 00:00:12,072 --> 00:00:15,647
/// This is the second subtitle.
///
/// 3
/// 00:00:18,210 --> 00:00:22,341
/// This is the third subtitle.
/// ```
///
/// ## Markup
///
/// Unofficially the format has very basic text formatting, which can be either interpreted or passed through for
/// rendering depending on the processing application. Formatting is derived from HTML tags for bold, italic, underline
/// and color:
///
/// - Bold – `<b> ... </b>`
/// - Italic – `<i> ... </i>`
/// - Underline – `<u> ... </u>`
/// - Font color – `<font color="color name or #code"> ... </font>`
/// - Nested tags are allowed; some implementations prefer whole-line formatting only.
///
/// Also unofficially, text coordinates can be specified at the end of the timestamp line as `X1:… X2:… Y1:… Y2:…`.
///
/// See [SubRip on Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SubRip)
///
/// ## Encoding
///
/// SubRip's default output encoding is configured as Windows-1252. However, output options are also given for many
/// Windows code pages as well as Unicode encodings, such as UTF-8 and UTF-16, with or without byte order mark (BOM).
/// Therefore, there is no official character encoding standard for `.srt` files, which means that any SubRip file
/// parser must attempt to use charset detection. Unicode BOMs are typically used to aid detection.
///
/// YouTube only supports UTF-8. The default encoding for subtitle files in FFmpeg is UTF-8. All text in a
/// Matroska file is encoded in UTF-8.

    /// File text encoding.
